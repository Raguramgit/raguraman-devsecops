# Module 4 – Build Tools (Maven, NPM, Python, .NET)

Build tools are the foundation of CI/CD.

Before containers, Kubernetes, or deployments,
every application must be **built correctly and consistently**.

This module focuses on:
- Understanding how applications are built across different tech stacks
- Working with real project repositories
- Building applications using the correct build tools
- Connecting applications to databases
- Running multi-tier applications locally
- Deploying applications to application servers
- Exposing applications using web servers

This is a **hands-on and execution-heavy module**.

## How to Complete This Module

- Complete the tasks listed in `tasks.md`
- Clone and build real project repositories
- Run applications locally and verify functionality
- Configure database connections properly
- Capture build outputs or logs where required
- Document what you did and what issues you faced
